Mongo DB commands
use <DB_NAME> - create or navigate to DB
show dbs - to see all db
db - to see current db we r in
db.dropDatabase() - delete DB

-->Collection level
db.createCollection("<COLLECTION_NAME>") - create collection
db.<COLLECTION_NAME>.drop() - drop collection

db.<COLLECTION_NAME>.find() -->  find all documents
db.<COLLECTION_NAME>.findOne() --> single doc in collection
db.<COLLECTION_NAME>.find({<KEY1>:<VALUE1>,<KEY2> : <VALUE2>, .....}) --> with condition one and more condition
db.<COLLECTION_NAME>.findOneReplace({<KEY1>:<VALUE1>,<KEY2> : <VALUE2>, .....}, <replacement>) ---> it will replace everything except _id key value
db.<COLLECTION_NAME>.findOneDelete({<KEY1>:<VALUE1>,<KEY2> : <VALUE2>, .....})

db.<COLLECTION_NAME>.insertOne({<KEY>:<VALUE>})
db.<COLLECTION_NAME>.insertMany([ {<KEY>:<VALUE>} , {<KEY>:<VALUE>}])

db.<COLLECTION_NAME>.update( {}, {$set : {} ) -> it will update only one doc by default but if multi:true is given then will update all doc same like updateMany()
db.<COLLECTION_NAME>.updateOne({})
db.<COLLECTION_NAME>.updateMany({})

deleteOne({<KEY> : <VALUE>})
CAREFULL===> deleteMany({}) --> empty braces it will delete all documents :( 

-->operators for MORE REFINE RESULT


**-->Get specific key's of document like I want to see all documents city only not all other key's
find({condition....} , { <KEY_Name> : 1 , <KEY_NAME> : 0 })
--> 1 correspondes to see that key
--> 0 do not show these key

Javascript is single threaded
-JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language, meaning that it executes one operation at a time in a single sequence. This means that JavaScript code is processed sequentially, and each operation must complete before the next one can start.

In a single-threaded environment, if a particular operation takes a long time to complete, it can block the execution of subsequent operations. For example, if a JavaScript function performs a lengthy computation or a blocking I/O operation, it will prevent other code from executing until it finishes.

However, it's important to note that JavaScript also has features that allow for asynchronous programming, enabling non-blocking behavior. This is achieved through mechanisms like callbacks, promises, and async/await. Asynchronous operations in JavaScript leverage event-driven programming and the browser's event loop to handle tasks concurrently without blocking the main thread.

By using asynchronous programming techniques, JavaScript can initiate tasks and continue executing other code while waiting for those tasks to complete. This allows for more efficient handling of I/O operations, such as making HTTP requests or reading files, without blocking the execution of the rest of the code.

So, while JavaScript is single-threaded by default, it provides mechanisms for asynchronous programming to handle concurrent tasks efficiently and avoid blocking operations.

-While JavaScript itself runs in a single thread, the browser or runtime environment may have additional threads for handling tasks like rendering, networking, or running Web Workers. These additional threads allow certain operations to be performed concurrently, but the JavaScript code execution itself remains single-threaded.
